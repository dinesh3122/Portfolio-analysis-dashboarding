This dashboard presents a full portfolio analytics case study, highlighting return multiples, profit, total invested capital, and alpha generation. It visualizes portfolio value growth over time, sector and round-level equity composition, adjusted alpha by company, and the relationship between post-money valuations and IRR. Additional metrics—such as overall IRR, benchmark IRR, and valuation multiples—provide a clear view of portfolio performance and value creation across investments.
